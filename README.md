## VIDHYA-LLM-001 (Custom Educational LLM)

This project is powered by VIDHYA-LLM, a proprietary, domain-specific Large Language Model developed specifically for educational institutions.

VIDHYA-LLM is designed to understand academic structures, institutional workflows, and structured educational data, enabling accurate and reliable report and document generation for schools and colleges.

### Model Identification :

   - **Model Name** - VIDHYA-LLM
   - **Model Numner** - VIDHYA-LLM-001
   - **zone** - public-clone-data-1
   - **version** -  1.0

### Purpose of VIDHYA-LLM-001 :

VIDHYA-LLM is optimized for:
 * Academic report generation
 * Teacher and class-level summaries
 * Structured educational content understanding

### Model Limitations :

* VIDHYA-LLM is not a general-purpose chatbot
* Outputs depend on provided institutional data
* Final academic decisions must be validated by educators or administrators

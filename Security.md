## Data Classification

The data used in this project is classified as follows:

| Data Type                | Description                                                                            | Accessibility                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Public Sample Datasets   | Limited data included for testing, demonstration, and authentication purposes          | Publicly available                 |
| Restricted Core Datasets | Academic records, teacher performance, student information, and institutional datasets | Restricted; access by request only |

**Sensitive Data Includes:**

* Student personal information (name, ID, contact, performance)
* Parent/guardian details
* Teacher and staff records
* Institutional operational data

## Security Measures

To protect data integrity and confidentiality, the following measures are implemented:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

   * Users have access only to the datasets necessary for their roles.

2. **Data Encryption**

   * All sensitive datasets are encrypted at rest and during transmission.

3. **Access Logging**

   * All access and modification actions are logged for auditing purposes.

4. **Secure Communication**

   * Emails and file transfers use secure protocols to prevent unauthorized interception.

5. **Compliance**

   * All data handling complies with institutional policies and relevant privacy laws.

## Dataset Access Policy

* **Public datasets:** Available for testing and demonstration.
* **Restricted datasets:** Access requires permission from the data owner.
* **Request process:**

  1. Submit an email with organization name, purpose, intended use, data handling measures, and duration.
  2. Review of request is manual and only approved for valid, responsible, and compliant purposes.
